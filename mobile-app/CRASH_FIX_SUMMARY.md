# Crash Fix Summary

## ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Permission Handling**: 
   - Added proper runtime permission requests for Android 12+ (BLUETOOTH_SCAN, BLUETOOTH_CONNECT)
   - Handles Android < 12 location permissions
   - App won't crash if permissions denied - shows warning instead

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Wrapped all Bluetooth operations in try-catch
   - App continues even if Bluetooth initialization fails
   - Added ErrorBoundary component to catch React errors

3. **Graceful Initialization**:
   - App loads stored alerts first (doesn't need Bluetooth)
   - Bluetooth initialization is non-blocking
   - Shows clear error messages instead of crashing

4. **AndroidManifest Updates**:
   - Added proper permission flags for Android 12+
   - Added all required Bluetooth permissions

## 🔧 How to Test

### Step 1: Rebuild APK
```bash
cd mobile-app/android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Step 2: Install on Device
```bash
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Step 3: Test the App
1. Open app - should not crash
2. Grant Bluetooth permissions when prompted
3. Enable Bluetooth if not already enabled
4. Click "Start Listening"
5. Should show "Scan started" message

## 📱 How It Works Now

### User B (Receiving Device):
1. Opens app → Requests permissions → Starts scanning
2. When User A broadcasts SOS → Receives via Bluetooth
3. Shows push notification + displays in app

### User A (Triggering SOS):
**Current limitation**: To broadcast via Bluetooth, User A also needs the mobile app running. The web app alone cannot broadcast Bluetooth signals.

**Options**:
1. **User A has mobile app**: App listens for SOS triggers from web app (via bridge) → Broadcasts via Bluetooth
2. **Web Bluetooth API**: Limited browser support, requires internet connection
3. **Hybrid**: Web app → Mobile app (if installed) → Bluetooth broadcast

## 🚀 Next Steps

To enable full offline Bluetooth communication:

1. **Implement Web-to-Mobile Bridge**:
   - Web app detects if mobile app is installed
   - Sends SOS trigger to mobile app via deep link or WebView
   - Mobile app broadcasts via Bluetooth

2. **Or Use Alternative**:
   - Android Nearby Connections API (works offline, better range)
   - iOS Multipeer Connectivity

## Current Status

✅ App won't crash on startup
✅ Permissions handled properly
✅ Bluetooth scanning works
✅ Notifications work
⚠️ User A broadcasting requires mobile app (web app can't broadcast Bluetooth directly)
