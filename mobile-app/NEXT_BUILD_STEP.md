# ✅ Metro Config Fixed - Try Building Again!

## What Was Fixed

✅ Created `metro.config.js` - React Native bundler config

## Now Try Building:

```bash
cd /home/shifu/Downloads/aarogya-connect-live-main/mobile-app/android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Expected Result

If successful, you'll find your APK at:
```
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

This file can be shared and installed on any Android device!

## If You Get More Errors

Common issues:
1. **"Metro bundler not found"** - Run `npm install` in mobile-app directory
2. **"node_modules missing"** - Run `npm install` in mobile-app directory
3. **Build succeeds but APK missing** - Check `app/build/outputs/apk/release/` directory

## Quick Check

Before building, verify:
```bash
cd /home/shifu/Downloads/aarogya-connect-live-main/mobile-app
ls -la metro.config.js  # Should exist
npm list @react-native/metro-config  # Should show version
```

Then build:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
