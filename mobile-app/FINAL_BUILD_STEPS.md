# Final Build Steps - Almost There! 🚀

## ✅ What's Fixed

1. ✅ Created `local.properties` with SDK path: `/usr/lib/android-sdk`
2. ✅ Fixed `compileSdkVersion` error
3. ✅ Removed invalid `autolinkLibrariesWithApp()` call
4. ✅ Java 21 is installed (should work fine)

## 🏗️ Build the APK

```bash
cd /home/shifu/Downloads/aarogya-connect-live-main/mobile-app/android

# Clean previous builds
./gradlew clean

# Build release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## 📱 Find Your APK

After successful build, the APK will be at:

```
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

**This file can be shared with anyone!**

## 🔧 If You Get Java Errors

Even though Java 21 is installed, if Gradle complains:

```bash
# Find Java path
readlink -f $(which java) | sed 's|/bin/java||'

# Set JAVA_HOME (add to ~/.zshrc)
export JAVA_HOME=/path/from/above/command

# Or if using system Java:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
```

Then retry the build.

## 📤 Share the APK

1. **Email**: Attach the APK file
2. **Google Drive**: Upload and share link
3. **USB Transfer**: Copy to phone and install
4. **Direct Install**: Use `adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## ✅ You're Ready!

The `local.properties` file is created. Try running `./gradlew assembleRelease` now!
